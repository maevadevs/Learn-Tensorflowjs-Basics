# TensorFlow.js Demo

This is the basic getting started demo of TensorFlow.js using:

- TensorFlow.js
- Webpack
- Babel
- ESLint

**Note: This is for development purposes only. This is not production-ready. Webpack is using Source-Maps and `mode: 'development'`.**

## Commands

- `npm run build`: Run webpack once.
- `npm run buildW`: Run webpack in watch mode.
- `npm start`: Run webpack once and start webpack-dev-server on port 8000.
