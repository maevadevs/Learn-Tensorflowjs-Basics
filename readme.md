# TensorFlow.js Basic Setup

This is the basic setup of TensorFlow.js using:

- [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

**Note: This is for development purposes only. This is not production-ready. Webpack is using Source-Maps and `mode: 'development'`.**

## Commands

First, run `npm install` or `yarn install`, then use one of the commands below to start.

- `npm run build` or `yarn run build`: Run webpack once.
- `npm run buildW` or `yarn run buildW`: Run webpack in watch mode.
- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Run webpack once and start webpack-dev-server on port 8000.
